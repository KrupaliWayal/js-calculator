## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a simple and attractive calculator that supports:

- Number input (0–9)
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Decimal point (.)
- Clear button (C) to reset the screen
- Backspace (⌫) to delete the last digit
- Percentage (%) calculation
- Equals (=) button to evaluate the expression

The UI is clean and responsive, and the buttons are arranged in a real calculator-like layout. It’s a great practice project for beginners to understand the DOM, event handling, and layout using CSS Grid.

## 📈 What I Would Improve with More Time

If I had more time to work on this project, I would consider adding:

- **Keyboard input support** (e.g. press `1`, `+`, `Enter`)
- **Dark mode toggle** for better UI customization
- **Improved error handling** (e.g. show better messages for invalid inputs)
- **History feature** to keep track of previous calculations
- **Mobile responsiveness tweaks** for smaller devices
- **Sound or animation effects** on button clicks
